# Air Landing Page

The aim of this project is to present the creative commercial agency as a company with innovative strategies, fresh ideas, a wide range of services, and skilled staff.

The landing page comprises a number of sections, namely:
- a header with a navigation menu;
- the introductory section with a slider;
- three sections presenting the objectives of the company and its services;
- the "testimonials" section introducing the senior staff;
- a contact section with a form and contact information;
- a footer with useful links.
